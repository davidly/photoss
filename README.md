# photoss
Windows photo screen saver. 

Extremely simple screen saver that cycles through photos in a folder. 

Control the folder with photos, the delay between photos, the delay before the screen turns black, and
whether to show the capture date in the photo and the current time.

Build with m.bat.

To use: copy photoss.exe to %windir%\system32\photoss.scr

Then go in the control panel screen saver setup and select photoss.
